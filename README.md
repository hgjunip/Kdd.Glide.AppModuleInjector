# Repro of the issue that prevents us from adding our own Glide modules

This is a fork of the repo that allowed us to use our own Glide modules in Xamarin forms. We've modified it to show the issue. 
The BrokenMauiApp project references the UpdatedGlideModuleBindingLibrary which binds the android aar generated by building the project in the Native folder.
